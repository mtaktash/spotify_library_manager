# spotify_library_manager

1. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Get `client_id` and `client_secret` by creating an app on https://developer.spotify.com/. Set redirect uri to something like http://127.0.0.1:9090
3. `python main.py --client_id %client_id% --client_secret %client_secret% "spotify playlist name" "tidal playlist name"`
